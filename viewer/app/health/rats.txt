Gene therapy reverses rat's paralysis
Scientists say they have taken a significant step towards the goal of giving paralysed people control of their hands again.

The team at King's College London used gene therapy to repair damage in the spinal cord of rats.

The animals could then pick up and eat sugar cubes with their front paws.

It is early stage research, but experts said it was some of the most compelling evidence that people's hand function could one day be restored.

The spinal cord is a dense tube of nerves carrying instructions from the brain to the rest of the body.

The body repairs a wounded spinal cord with scar tissue.

However, the scar acts like a barrier to new connections forming between nerves.

How the gene therapy works
The researchers were trying to dissolve components of the scar tissue in the rats' spinal cord.

They needed to give cells in the cord a new set of genetic instructions - a gene - for breaking down the scar.

The instructions they gave were for an enzyme called chondroitinase. And they used a virus to deliver them.

Finally, a drug was used to activate the instructions.
